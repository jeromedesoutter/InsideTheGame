Key Door (Super Mario Bros. 3) from Super Mario Maker

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D.


Info:
I made this for the sake of a diorama for one of my Super Mario Maker courses.
The door is red when locked and orange/brown when unlocked.
The doorknob should only be visible when the door is unlocked.
